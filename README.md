You'll need to have a few libraries installed to use our program, you'll need nltk, plotnine, pandas, urllib, BeautifulSoup, and matplotlib.pyplot. But don't worry, we won't make you fetch and install them one-by-one like you're on some kind code scavenger hunt.

Once you've got everything set up, enter the names of the stocks or companies you want to analyze, and let our program do the rest. And if you get tired of typing names, you can always enter "Default" to see how we work with a sample list of stock listings. Or, if you're feeling like you're done, you can always type "Done" to finish entering your desired stock listings.
